Final project for the MIC class

## mbuild
mBuild does hierarchical modeling, using the Composite pattern. The leaves of the hierarchy are particles (atoms). Atoms can be composed into Components, and Components can be composed into more complex components. In mBuild, Ports define the geometric constraints of the composition.
### mbuild in WebGME
1. Metamodel to describe the whole hierarchy in the chemistry field like Atom, Port, Molecule, Polymer and Copolymer.
2. Higher level examples such as, Methane, Ethane, complicated copolymer.
3. Plug-in to generate python file based on the model.
4. Visualize dynamically for the model inside of the WebGME.
5. Easily get a visualization for the example you build.
